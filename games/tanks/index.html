	<h3>Diesel Tanks</h3>
	<p>So this is a really basic tanks game. The idea is that playing games with friends is fun. So, we put a tanks game on the big screen, wire it up to the internet, and then people can control their tank with their cell phone.</p>
	<p> Good times.</p>

	<h3>How to get it going</h3>
	<p>At this point you should open up a copy of the <a href="receiver.html">server page</a> on whatever device people can all see.  If you have a chromecast you can chrome cast it. Then all the players open the <a href="client.html">client page</a> and enter the game code and should just show up on the list.</p>
	<p> Players who join late will be added at the beginning of the next round.</p>

	<h3>Requirements</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Web Sockets</b> This is the big one the game uses websockets to connect the clients and the server. You can check you have them <a href="https://www.websocket.org/echo.html">here</a>. Note that some versions of the browser in older versions of android lie about supporting web sockets. Chrome for Android does work if you have having mysterious issues.</li>
		<li><b>HTML5 canvas</b>
		The server page really needs this.  The client does to but you can probably get away with out it with soemc areful quicnting and lcuk on knowing what weapons you have.

	<h3>Handy Tips</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>diesel.game.sounds.enabled =true</b> in console on the server will enable sound. These are awful. That's why they are disabled by default.</li>
