About Diesel.js

Diesel.js is an event driven html5 game engine.

It is deisgned to make writing simple html 5 games simple, and provide a simple system of events that your game code can listen for to allow you to create a simple game. this means that unless your game code causes an error that make sthe game objects not start up correctly, diesel should keep pumping events out.

Diesel provides:

events
	init - called before diesel starts up stuff.
	startup - called after preloading finished
	draw - called once per tick (# of ticks since last frame)
	update -called once per tick (# of ticks since last frame)
	
some simple utilities
	sprite engine
	preload system
	localStorage interface for json.
	debug overlay (frame rates mouse coords etc);
	

It expects a game object defined in the global namespace.

the game object is called at init time. All other diesel code should be agnostic to the existence of the game code.
Basically if there are a certain properties they can be exploited to do preloading and the like. if not diesel should print a bunch of error messages and then startup anyway.
