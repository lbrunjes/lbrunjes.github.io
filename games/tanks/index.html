	<h3>Diesel Tanks</h3>
	<p>So this is a really basic tanks game. The idea is that playing games with friends is fun. So, we put a tanks game on the big screen, wire it up to the internet, and then people can control their tank with their cell phone.</p>
	<p> good times.</p>

	<h3>How to get it going</h3>
	<p>At this point you should open up a copy of the <a href="receiver.html">server page</a> on whatever device people can all see.  If you have a chromecast you can chrome cast it. Then all the players open the <a href="client.html">client page</a> and enter the game code and should just show up on the list.</p>
	<p> Players who join late will be added at the beginning of the next round.</p>

	<h3>Requirements</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Web Sockets</b> This is the big one the game sues websockets to connec thte clients and the server. You can check you have them <a href="https://www.websocket.org/echo.html">here</a>. Note that The default browser in older versions of android lies about supporting web sockets. Chrome for Android does work if you have having mysterious issues.</li>

	<h3>Handy Tips</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>diesel.game.sounds.enabled =true</b> in console on the server will enable sound. These are awful. That's why they are disabled by default.</li>
