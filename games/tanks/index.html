<h3>Diesel Tanks</h3>
<p>So this is a really basic tanks game. The idea is that playing games with friends is fun. So we put a tanks game on the screen. wire it up to the internet and then people can control their tank with their cell phone</p>

<p>At this point you shoudl open up a copy of the <a href="receiver.html">server page</a>.  If you have a chromecast you should chrome cast it. then all the players open the <a href="client.html">client page</a> and enter the game code and should just show up.</p>

<p>If somehthing goes wrong drop me a note.</p>

<h4>Handy Tips</h4>
<p> <b>client.sounds.enabled =true</b> in console will enable sound</p>
