<h3>Diesel Tanks</h3>
<img src="icon.html" width="64" height="64" style="float:left;"/>
<p>So this is a really basic tanks game. The idea is that playing games with friends is fun. So we put a tanks game on the screen, wire it up to the internet and then people can control their tank with their cell phone</p>

<p>At this point you should open up a copy of the <a href="receiver.html">server page</a>.  If you have a chromecast you should chrome cast it. Then all the players open the <a href="client.html">client page</a> and enter the game code and should just show up.Players who join late will be added at the next round start.</p>
