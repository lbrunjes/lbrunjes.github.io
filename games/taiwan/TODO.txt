COMMMIT STUFF TO GIT DUDE!


BORKES:
I should setup diesel to simply generate events instead of reading the game objects. that way the game object can do whatever it wants.
	this si outside project scope but it would be neat to rewrite diesel to simple generate events.

	
ADD:
	Items
		picku with use
		have teh player start witha weapon
		dis allow picking up items that the player already has.
	Shops
	
	
	Combat
		give the player a weapon and a way to attack
		this is going to require an inventory
	add Witches
		need a curse weapons thet they leave laying around.
	
	add Some sort of food item
		buns and dumplings prime candidates
	
	at a neutral mob
		bears or cows or something
		ignores teh palyer unless attacked.
	
		
	movement needs to be less stupid feeling.(eh)
		probably simply let teh player moe and flag a number of player moves to allow before the enemy can move.
		this seems better with the new solid frame rate;

	Shold probably write grunt tests/set up but god I hate grunt projects
